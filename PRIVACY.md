# Privacy Policy for GCal Colorizer

**Last updated:** [Current Date]

## Overview

GCal Colorizer is a Chrome extension that automatically applies colors to Google Calendar events based on keywords in event titles. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### What We Don't Collect:
- Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Calendar content or event details
- Browsing history or web activity
- User behavior or analytics data
- Any information about your Google Calendar events

### What We Store Locally:
- **Keyword-to-color rules**: Your custom rules (e.g., "meeting" â†’ red) are stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- **Extension settings**: Basic configuration preferences

## How It Works

1. **Local Processing**: All keyword matching happens locally in your browser
2. **No External Servers**: We don't have any servers that receive your data
3. **Chrome Storage**: Your rules are stored securely using Chrome's built-in storage system
4. **Cross-Device Sync**: Rules sync across your devices through Chrome's sync feature (if enabled)

## Data Usage

Your keyword rules are used solely for:
- Matching keywords in event titles
- Applying the corresponding colors to Google Calendar events
- No other purpose

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there's no personal information to access, modify, or delete. You can:
- Remove the extension at any time
- Clear your rules through the extension settings
- Disable Chrome sync to prevent cross-device rule sharing

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
